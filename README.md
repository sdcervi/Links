### Summary
I built Links as an alternative to Linktree and other link-in-bio services.  As a professional web designer, I felt that this was another chance to showcase my work, and another opportunity to improve my customers' experience.

### Technologies
Links was built using the Bootstrap 5.1 framework, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I designed the interface using a mobile-first perspective to streamline the user experience on all device sizes.

### Project status
Links is being actively maintained and updated with new content.  Bugs are logged and fixed as discovered.
