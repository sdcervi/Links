		<h1>Kratky Kit Instructions</h1>
		
		<p>Congratulations on your new Kratky jar hydroponics kit!  Getting started is fairly simple and straightforward.  Everyone develops a slightly different method of setting up and maintaining their jars; these are the steps I use, and recommend for any beginners.</p>
		
		<p>Depending on your kit configuration, the supplies you received may look different.  If you ordered a Base Kit, you&rsquo;ll need to supply your own wide-mouth 1L or 32oz mason jar.</p>
		
		<h2>Materials</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>One of the following:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>1L or 32oz wide-mouth glass mason jar</li>
				<li>40oz Jif peanut butter jar, with adapter ring to reduce opening size</li>
				<li>Other jar with a 3" or 7.5cm opening</li>
			</ul>
			<li>One of the following:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Plastic shroud cover for your jar</li>
				<li>Opaque paper bag that fits over your jar, and a rubber band to hold it in place</li>
				<li>Black acrylic paint or black spray paint, and painter&rsquo;s masking tape</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Plastic net pot</li>
			<li>Clay pebbles</li>
			<li>Rock wool cube (optional)</li>
			<li>Nutrient powder</li>
			<li>1 gallon jug to mix nutrient solution (I recommend buying a plastic jug of spring water from the grocery store.)</li>
			<li>Clean spray bottle filled with tap water</li>
			<li>A sunny windowsill, or a grow light</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Preparing your jar</h2>
		
		<p>For best results, fully clean your jar.</p>
			
		<p><strong>Plastic jars:</strong> Wash thoroughly with hot water and soap, and rinse until there is absolutely no soap residue left.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Glass jars:</strong> Wash thoroughly with hot water and soap, then submerge in boiling water for ten minutes.</p>		
		
		<p>Wait for your jars to cool and fully dry.</p>
		
		<h3>Making the jar light-proof</h3>
		
		<p><strong>Shroud covers:</strong> place the cover around the jar so that it fully encloses the jar.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Paper bag:</strong> Put the jar into the paper bag so that the jar opening is at the top of the bag.  Shape the paper bag to the jar by pressing it in, and use the rubber bad to secure the top of the paper bag at the neck of the jar.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Paint:</strong> Put a stripe of masking tape vertically from the top to the bottom of one side of the jar; this will act as your window for you to see the water level inside the jar.  Apply enough paint with a brush or spray can to make the jar fully opaque; test this by shining your phone&rsquo;s flashlight into the jar and checking to see if you see any light through the paint.  Once the paint is dry, carefully peel up the tape to expose the unpainted glass window.</p>
		
		<h2>Assembling your Kratky jar</h2>
		
		<p>If you&rsquo;re using a rock wool cube, soak it in clean water for at least ten minutes.  Squeeze out, change the water, and soak again for another ten minutes.</p>
		
		<p>Thoroughly rinse your clay pebbles until the water runs clear.</p>
		
		<p>Place the plastic net pot into the top of your prepared jar.  Add the clay pebbles carefully; they tend to bounce around if you pour them in too quickly.  If you&rsquo;re using a rock wool cube, hold that in place and pour the clay pebbles in around it.</p>
		
		<p>Add the nutrient powder to the empty 1 gallon jug, then fill with tap water until full.  Shake to mix thoroughly.</p>
		
		<p>Slowly pour in the nutrient-fortified water until the water level is about 1/2" or 1.5cm from the top of the jar.</p>
		
		<p>Sprinkle your seeds on top of the damp clay pebbles, or add them to the rock wool cube.</p>
		
		<h2>Germinating seeds</h2>
		
		<p>Twice to three times a day, gently spritz the seeds with water from the spray bottle.  As they germinate and send down roots, they will reach the top of the water.  The seedlings will gradually drink up the water as they grow and develop their root systems.</p>
		
		<p>Once the roots reach the water, you can stop spraying the surface of the pebbles.</p>
		
		<p>Place in a sunny windowsill or under a grow light, and enjoy your plants!</p>
		
		<h2>Maintaining and watering your plants</h2>
		
		<p>When the water level gets to about 1/4" the height of the jar, top up with nutrient-fortified water until it&rsquo;s around half the height of the jar.  Don&rsquo;t overfill!  This will drown the roots and kill your plants.</p>
		
		<p>Harvest as needed, but never harvest more than 60% of your plant unless you&rsquo;s harvesting everything.  Trim off any dead, yellowed, or diseased parts of the plant and compost them.</p>
		
		<h2>Cleaning and preparing for the next plant</h2>
		
		<p>When you&rsquo;re ready to re-plant your jars, get a large bowl or plastic bin since this is a somewhat messy job.  Wait for the jar to dry out or drain all the water from it.  Tip it on its side and carefully pull the net pot out; this may give you some resistance if there are a lot of roots.  Just wiggle the pot back and forth to ease the roots out of the jar opening.</p>
		
		<p>Gently shake as many of the clay pebbles out of the net pot as will easily come out; leave them in the bowl or bin for now.  You may need to cut the roots away from the bottom of the net pot with sturdy scissors.  Remove all the roots and pebbles from the net pot, then wash it thoroughly with hot soapy water.</p>
		
		<p>Tease the clay pebbles out of the roots.  Compost any remaining parts of the old plant including roots, stems, etc.</p>
		
		<p>You may need to sift through the clay pebbles to get rid of any plant detritus.  Once you have all the pebbles collected, wash and rinse them.</p>
		
		<p>Scrub away any residue on the inside of your jar, then begin preparing your jar again according to the directions above.</p>
